Consistent with the traumatic event, her nightmare included images of her and the service members on the first truck smiling and waving at those on the second truck, and the service members on the second truck making fun of the broken truck and their efforts to fix it — “Look at that piece of junk truck — good luck getting that clunker fixed.'\n",

For example, one of the thoughts she recorded related to the explosion was, “I should have had them wait and not had them go on.” She recorded her related feeling to be guilt.

In addition to a range of other PTSD symptoms, Jill had a recurring nightmare of the event in which she was the leader of a convoy and her lead truck broke down. She waved the second truck forward, the truck that hit the IED, while she and her fellow service members on the first truck worked feverishly to repair it. Consistent with the traumatic event, her nightmare included images of her and the service members on the first truck smiling and waving at those on the second truck, and the service members on the second truck making fun of the broken truck and their efforts to fix it — “Look at that piece of junk truck — good luck getting that clunker fixed.”  After a thorough assessment of her PTSD and comorbid symptoms, psychoeducation about PTSD symptoms, and a rationale for using trauma focused cognitive interventions, Jill received 10 sessions of cognitive therapy for PTSD. She was first assigned cognitive worksheets to begin self-monitoring events, her thoughts about these events, and consequent feelings. These worksheets were used to sensitize Jill to the types of cognitions that she was having about current day events and to appraisals that she had about the explosion. For example, one of the thoughts she recorded related to the explosion was, “I should have had them wait and not had them go on.” She recorded her related feeling to be guilt. Jill’s therapist used this worksheet as a starting point for engaging in Socratic dialogue, as shown in the following example:  \n",

      "assistant: It's understandable that you may have trouble forgetting what happened. Traumatic experiences can stay with us for a long time, especially when they involve the loss of loved ones or other intense emotions. However, the goal of therapy is not necessarily to forget the past, but to learn how to manage the thoughts and feelings associated with it in a way that allows you to lead a fulfilling life in the present. Together, we can work on developing coping skills that can help you manage your PTSD symptoms and process your experience in a healthy way.\n",

      "assistant: One way to start addressing your PTSD symptoms is through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which is a type of therapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behavior. In CBT, we will work together to identify negative thoughts and beliefs related to your traumatic experience and replace them with more balanced and realistic ones. We will also work on developing coping skills such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and exposure therapy to help you manage your symptoms. Additionally, we can explore other treatment options such as medication and support groups. Rest assured, you don't have to go through this alone and we can work together to help you feel better.\n",

However, it's important to remember that you are not to blame for what happened. PTSD can often make us feel like we are responsible for events that were out of our control, but it's important to challenge these thoughts and remind yourself that you did the best you could in a difficult situation. As for your teammates, it's impossible to say for certain how they would feel about the event. However, it's important to remind yourself that you did not cause the explosion and that everyone involved was doing their best to keep themselves and each other safe.\n",

Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other.', metadata={'Answers': \"While a lot of people think of grief in terms of losing a person or pet, grief can come up whenever you lose something important. This includes: \\n Losing security, like losing your job or wondering how long you'll be able to pay rent \\n Losing stability or routine, like finding yourself working from home or navigating childcare closures \\n Losing your sense of safety, like fearing you or someone you love might end up with COVID-19 \\n Losing your social relationships, like missing time with family and friends now that everyone must practice physical distancing or self-isolation \\n Losing hope for the future, like feeling that life will never go back to normal \\n Losing important goals, like finding your classes, sports competitions, or performances are cancelled for the foreseeable future \\n Losing important milestone celebrations like graduation ceremonies and weddings \\n Grief bring up complicated feelings. You might feel sad, angry, frustrated, fearful, or hopeless. You may have a hard time eating or sleeping, or feel very tense. You may feel overwhelmed and tired. You may wonder if life will ever feel normal again. \\n Everyone grieves in their own way and their own time. Here are some strategies to try as you navigate your own journey. \\n Acknowledge and express your feelings in a healthy way. Give your feelings a name and find healthy ways to express them, such as by talking with a friend, writing in a journal, or making art. \\n Give yourself as much time as you need. Grief follows its own schedule. Give yourself permission to use this time to take care of your well-being. Let go of expectations, tasks, or other obligations that can wait. \\n Seek support. Grief can feel very isolating, even though a lot of people are experiencing some sort of loss right now. Reach out to friends or family and share your feelings. Look for ways to help and support each other. \\n Take care of yourself. Ignoring health and well-being can make difficult experiences feel worse. Eat as well as you can, try to get enough sleep, spend time outside if it's safe for you to do so, and exercise regularly. Think about self-care activities or strategies that have helped you cope with challenging situations in the past and make time for those activities. \\n Know that feelings of grief will pass. Grief may feel intense at times, but those feelings will become more manageable over time and will eventually pass. \\n Connect with a mental health professional if you're having a hard time. If you're having a hard time getting through the day, coping in unhealthy ways, or having a hard time managing difficult thoughts or feelings, it's a good idea to seek help from a professional like a psychologist or counsellor—many now offer online or phone appointments.

We're all in this together. \\n While you may be physically separated from friends, family members, and other loved ones, it has never been more important to maintain those social connections. Social connections are an opportunity to seek and share support, talk through difficult feelings, share a laugh, keep up-to-date with loved ones, and help each other cope. This pandemic is a lot for one person to deal with on their own. While measures like physical distancing and self-isolation are necessary to slow the spread of the virus, the physical separation can amplify a lot of challenging emotions like loneliness and fear. \\n Think about the different ways to connect that are most meaningful for you. For example, you might prefer a video chat over a phone call, or you might prefer to text throughout the day rather than one set time for a video call. Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. \\n Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. \\n The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. \\n Everyone feels lonely at times—maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. \\n Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. \\n Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. \\n Look for specialized support groups.
